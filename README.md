This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
* Data Modeling :we Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.
* Data engineering: we Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
we verify that the column is unique, which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
we create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
* Data analysis :1 List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2 List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
